Yahallo !!

About me:

        I'm just an average 17 year old person who installed twrp for the first time in March 2020 in order to root my J5 prime to try to install fortnite on that old arm32 device.ðŸ˜œ
 Was able to root but failed miserably in my goal xD but thnx to @asarr22 's Project Radical and Project Kebab learned a ton about Android tweaking and due to lack of development for the device ked to my projects. Not gonna make this intro any more boring cause if you have read so far then i wouldnt want to bore you any further. Anyway here's a quick and boring list of some of the people who have played in important part in making me who I am today and helping me throughout my projects:
 
        @asarr22, @soulr344, @hendamanu, @simons3421, @astrako, @stolethesauce, @fiestalake,
        @khalvat-m, @cnkzlyr, @erfanoabdi and the person who helped me the most @DarthJabba9
