Yahallo !!

About me:
        (Boring story ahead xD)

        I'm just an average 17 year old person who installed twrp for the first time 
        in March 2020 in order to root my J5 prime to try to install fortnite on that old arm32 device.
        Was able to root but failed miserably in my goal xD (try to figure out why) but thnx 
        to @asarr22 's Project Radical and Project Kebab learned a ton about Android tweaking 
        and the lack of development for that device led to me trying my projects. 

Not gonna make this intro any more boring cause if you have read so far then I wouldn't want to bore you any further.
Anyway here's a quick and boring list of some of the people who have played in important part in making me who I am today
and helping me throughout my projects:
 


        @asarr22, @soulr344, @hendamanu, @simons1920, @astrako, @stolethesauce, @fiestalake,
        @khalvat-m, @cnkzlyr, @erfanoabdi and the person who helped me the most @DarthJabba9
